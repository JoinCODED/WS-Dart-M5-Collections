A `collection` is a group of values that belong together.

In Dart, There are many types of `collection`s. We are going to go through three of them:

1. Lists.
2. Sets.
3. Maps.

Some of the `collection` types implement **iterable**, which means that we can go over all the items in the `collection` to run a specific function on each object in it, getting the number of items in a `collection`, or getting the first object, and more.

In the `collection` types we mentioned above, `List`s and `Set`s are iterable. However, `Map`s are not.

We will elaborate this more in the following sections.
